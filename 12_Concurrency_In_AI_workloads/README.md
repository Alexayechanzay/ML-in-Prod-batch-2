### Apache Spark
Apache Spark is a unified analytics engine that allows large-scale data processing across clusters of computers. It's known for its speed, ease of use, and support for a wide range of data processing tasks such as:
- Batch processing
- Streaming data
- Machine learning
- Graph processing


### Key Features of PySpark
Distributed Computing: Runs code across multiple machines.

Lazy Evaluation: Optimizes execution plans before running them.

In-Memory Processing: Faster than traditional disk-based engines like Hadoop MapReduce.

Compatibility: Works well with Python libraries like pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn.
