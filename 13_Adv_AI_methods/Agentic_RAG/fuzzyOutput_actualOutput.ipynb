Here are our top tips:Celebrate San Fran’s History and Diversity San Francisco is a culturally diverse city with a legacy of artistic expression and Bohemian culture alongside some of the greatest tech innovations. So, if you’re looking for guest speakers at a conference, invite people from the local tech sector and/or local artists to participate. If you’re using a venue that offers meals or catering, choose one that exemplifies San Fran’s rich cultural diversity in their cuisine. This is an opportunity to introduce attendees to other cultures and celebrate diversity within their organization.  Be Open to Multi-Purpose Venues There are many venues that, while not intended solely for corporate use, have meeting rooms or conferencing setups. In between the meetings or when the conference is over, attendees can then move to the other spaces for food and drinks.With clever planning, many venues ordinarily used for private events can be used for meetings, conferences, and other corporate events. Restaurants and social clubs already have the space and tables and chairs you’ll need for meetings. Lounge areas can be used for informal networking.You’ll find the perfect venue for every occasion on the Perfect Venue Marketplace. Consider the Needs of Attendees From Out of TownAre you planning a large conference for a company with nationwide branches? Attendees who don’t live nearby will have to travel and be accommodated locally while attending the San Fran meetings. In such cases, a hotel venue with corporate event facilities may be best.Organizing car hire is common with large conferences. But navigating San Francisco’s hilly terrain and steep streets can be very challenging for non-locals. Make their lives easier with a guide to Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) trains, buses and streetcars (Muni Metro), and ferries. Find the Perfect San Fran Venue on Perfect Venue MarketplaceThe City by the Bay has countless restaurants, hotels, and other venues for all types of events, from large corporate conferences to small business meetings.
