In the Transformer this is reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as described in section 3.2. Self-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 22, 23, 19]. End-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence- aligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and language modeling tasks [28].

In other words, the self-attention mechanism enables the model to weigh the importance of different elements in an input sequence and dynamically adjust their influence on the output. This is especially important for language processing tasks, where the meaning of a word can change based on its context within a sentence or document. [...] To overcome this issue, attention mechanisms were introduced to give access to all sequence elements at each time step. The key is to be selective and determine which words are most important in a specific context. In 2017, the transformer architecture introduced a standalone self-attention mechanism, eliminating the need for RNNs altogether. [...] In this article, we saw how self-attention works using a step-by-step coding approach. We then extended this concept to multi-head attention, the widely used component of large-language transformers. After discussing self-attention and multi-head attention, we introduced yet another concept: cross-attention, which is a flavor of self-attention that we can apply between two different sequences.'}]"
