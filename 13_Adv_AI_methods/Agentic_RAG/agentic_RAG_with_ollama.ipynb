In the Transformer this is reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as described in section 3.2. Self-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 22, 23, 19]. End-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence- aligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and language modeling tasks [28]. To the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer\\n\\nIn terms of computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence lengthnis smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with sentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece [31] and byte-pair [ 25] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving very long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size rin 6\\n\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden statesht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1and the input for position t. This inherently sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved signiﬁcant improvements in computational efﬁciency through factorization tricks [ 18] and conditional computation [ 26], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental constraint of sequential computation, however, remains. Attention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc- tion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in the input or output sequences [ 2,16].

Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the encoder. •Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to all positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward information ﬂow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this inside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input of the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2. 3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks In addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully connected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically.

Another is the amount of computation that can be parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required. The third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range dependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the ability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to traverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input and output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [ 11]. Hence we also compare the maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the different layer types. As noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially executed operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n)sequential operations.\n",

We employ a residual connection [ 10] around each of the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is LayerNorm( x+ Sublayer( x), where Sublayer(x)is the function implemented by the sub-layer itself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding layers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512 . Decoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N= 6identical layers. In addition to the two sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head attention over the output of the encoder stack.

The U-Net architecture consists of an encoder path and a decoder path. The encoder path gradually reduces the spatial dimensions of the input image while increasing the number of feature channels. This helps in extracting abstract and high-level features. The decoder path performs upsampling and concatenation operations. And recover the spatial dimensions while reducing the number of feature channels. The network learns to combine the low-level [...] This article will tell about the U-Net structure, a popular neural network used for image segmentation. U-Net is specially created with a structure that consists of both an encoder and a decoder, as well as skip connections, which allows it to make precise predictions for every pixel within an image. Describing the U-Net structure helps us grasp its efficiency in different fields.\\nThis article was published as a part of the\\xa0Data Science Blogathon.\\nTable of contents [...] Hope you like the article about the U-Net structure, a widely-used neural network designed for image segmentation. U-Net features an innovative design that includes both an encoder and a decoder, complemented by skip connections.

Segmentation of a 512\\xa0×\\xa0512 image takes less than a second on a modern (2015) GPU using the U-Net architecture.[1][3][4][5] [...] The main idea is to supplement a usual contracting network by successive layers, where pooling operations are replaced by upsampling operators. Hence these layers increase the resolution of the output. A successive convolutional layer can then learn to assemble a precise output based on this information.[1] [...] The network consists of a contracting path and an expansive path, which gives it the u-shaped architecture. The contracting path is a typical convolutional network that consists of repeated application of convolutions, each followed by a rectified linear unit (ReLU) and a max pooling operation. During the contraction, the spatial information is reduced while feature information is increased. The expansive pathway combines the feature and spatial information through a sequence of up-convolutions'}, {'url': 'https://medium.com/@alejandro.itoaramendia/decoding-the-u-net-a-complete-guide-810b1c6d56d8', 'content': 'The U-Net is an architecture that consists of 23 total layers. Using a combination of convolution, up-convolution, pooling and skip connections, the U-Net is able to extract and capture complex features, while also keeping and reconstructing spatial information.

This is especially useful in medical image analysis where accurately locating and detecting abnormalities is vital. [...] The U-Net is composed of two main components: a contracting path and an expanding path. [...] An input image with dimensions 572² is fed into the U-Net. This input image consists of only 1 channel, likely a grayscale channel.\\nTwo 3x3 convolution layers (unpadded) are then applied to the input image, each followed by a ReLU layer. At the same time the number of channels are increased to 64 in order to capture higher level features.\\nA 2x2 max pooling layer with a stride of 2 is then applied.

[...] Figure 1 illustrates how the U-Net network converts a grayscale input image of size 572×572×1 into a binary segmented output map of size 388×388×2. We can notice that the output size is smaller than the input size because no padding is being used. However, if we use padding, we can maintain the input size. During the contracting path, the input image is progressively reduced in height and width but increased in the number of channels. This increase in channels allows the network to capture [...] The contracting path in U-Net is responsible for identifying the relevant features in the input image. The encoder layers perform convolutional operations that reduce the spatial resolution of the feature maps while increasing their depth, thereby capturing increasingly abstract representations of the input.
